A Missing Piece in Climate Education
Did you Know?
Only 7% of references to climate change in primary education focus on
the social and emotional impact of environmental issues (UNESCO 2024).
The Gap0
Children grow up disconnected from nature!
Parents struggle to find engaging ways to teach sustainability!
Schools often lack interactive, hands-on climate education.
Our Solution :
Yute Toys World
merges play,
storytelling, and eco-
conscious toys to
teach sustainability in
a way that feels
natural, joyful, and
lasting.
Bridging Generations Through Play
Play is a universal language that connects all agesO
& Grandparents & aging adults often have more time to bond with
children, but struggle to find meaningful ways to connect
& Intergenerational play reduces loneliness, enhances cognitive function
in seniors, and nurtures empathy in children
& Toys & puzzles bridge this gap, helping seniors stay mentally active
while creating lasting memories with their grandchildren.
Our Solution :
Yute Toys World
creates timeless
wooden toys that
bring families
together.
